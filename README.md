# De-Swap

### Welcome to the De-Swap repo!!

De-swap was the final project of the Northcoders bootcamp. It was completed in a team of 4 and we all contributed to vatious elements of the app.

It is a peer-to-peer app where users can swap clothes with eachother. It is designed as a way to combat the huge wasefullness of the 'fast-fashion' industry.
Users can upload photos of their items as well as some information. They can then browse all the items from other users and click the 'request to swap' button on the ones they like.
This will open a live chat feature with the user who has listen that item. That user can the view the items belonging to the user who started the swap. If they see something they like,
they can 'request to swap' and the swapping process can proceed. When both users click 'confirm swap' they will be notified that the swap will be completed when they both click the 'confirm item sent' button.
When this happens, the items will sppear in the 'swapped' page for both users.

The app is built with React Native on expo. We have used firebase for our user authentication, firebase storage to store the uploads and cloud firestore for the live chat.
